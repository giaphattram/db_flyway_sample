# db_flyway_sample

This is an easy example how to create database migrations with [Flyway](http://flywaydb.org/)

It is bases on PostgreSQL database and should run right away after checking it out,
if your postgres-server is up and running. You might need to add assword to the
create- and drop-scripts depending on your database configuration for the postgres-user.
Of course you clean also easily switch the example to make use of another database by
changing JDBC imports and URL.

As it is not possible to create a new database with Flyway this needs to be done
outside of Flyway. The same is true for creating the database user that is used.
To do this there are two convenience scripts:
* createDatabaseAndUser.sh
* dropDatabaseAndUser.sh

## Execution using Maven

To execute the example just execute the create-script and then you can execute
Flyway using Maven like this

mvn clean compile flyway:migrate

## Execution using the Command Line Tool

Install the Flyway Command Line Tool according to [these instructions](http://flywaydb.org/documentation/commandline/)

Then execute the following command from the command line. The configuration file *flyway.conf* contains all the needed configuration for execution from the command line. The good thing is that Flyway already comes with JDBC drivers for [a good amount of database systems](http://flywaydb.org/documentation/commandline/) including PostgreSQL. Thus there is no need to install anything in addition here.
